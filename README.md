- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @michaelmontalbano
- ðŸ‘€ I use deep-learning to make forecasts about the weather. Currently using U-Nets to do something similar to this paper by Ryan Lagerquist, but with radar imagery and MESH swaths as our target. https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-21-0096.1
- My most recent coding is in the myrorss-deep-learning directory within SWAT: https://github.com/OUSWAT/myrorss-deep-learning
