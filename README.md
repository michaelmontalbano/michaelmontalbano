- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @michaelmontalbano
- If you are interested in exploring data explorations/loading on a supercomputer in addition to deep learning on such datasets, please visit my myrorss-deep-learning repository within the SWAT organization


- ðŸ‘€ I use deep-learning to make predictions  about the weather. Currently using U-Nets to do something similar to this paper this research,  but with radar imagery and MESH swaths as our target. https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-21-0096.1
- My most recent coding is in the myrorss-deep-learning directory within SWAT: https://github.com/OUSWAT/myrorss-deep-learning
